# Terminology
In this section some concepts and terms which occur in the protocol are explained.

## Struct
The term struct designates data type which contains variables of any types as properties. For example:
```c++
struct StructName {
    AnyType1 property1;
    AnyType2 property2;
    ...
    AnyTypeN propertyN;
}
```

## Enum
The term enum designates data type which contains the list of constants. For example:
```c++
enum EnumName {
    CONSTANT1;
    CONSTANT2;
    ...
    CONSTANTN;
}
```

## Array
To identify the variables that refer to the sequence data of any type used empty square brackets. For example:
```c++
anyType [] variableName
```

## Inheritance
Within this protocol inheritance like type "B" from the type "A" means that the type "B" contains the properties inherent in the type "A", and also some properties which can redefine type "A" properties. Such inheritance is designated as follows:
```c++
struct B: A {
    ...
}
```

# Serialization
Object serialization is performed in the JSON format. You can learn about data conversion to JSON format by following this link - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example 

Table of correspondences of the types used in the protocol in the JSON types:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>API type</td>
        <td>JSON type</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>number</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>string</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>struct</td>
        <td>object</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>enum</td>
        <td>string</td>
    </tr>
</table>


In case of POST requests objects of JSON are transferred with a key of **"jsonObj"**.

# Routing
For the appeal to methods from the section [Methods](#methods) the following template is used:
```
api/method_name
```

# Classes

## Common

### AccessToken
Object which identifies the user. **(TBD)**

### Data
This type is used in [Response](#responce).
```c++
struct Data { }
```

### AccessTokenData
```c++
struct AccessTokenData: Data {
    AccessToken accessToken;   
}
```

### UserInfoData
```c++
struct UserInfoData: Data {
    UserInfo user;
}
```

### GameInfoData
```c++
struct GameInfoData: Data {
   GameInfo [] game; 
}
```

### Response
```c++
struct Response {
    string result;
    string action;
    Data data;
}
```
Allowed values of **Response::result** specified for each method. Also this property can have the following values:
* "BadRequest"
* "InternalError"

## Access control

### UserInfo
```c++
struct UserInfo {
    int id;
    string login;
    string name;
}
```
#### Restrictions
for **UserInfo::login**:
```
[0-9a-zA-Z]{6, 36}
```
for **UserInfo::name**:
```
[a-zA-Z]{4, 32}
```

### Credentials
```c++
struct Credentials {
    string login;
    string password;
}
```
#### Restrictions 
for **Credentials::login**:
```
[0-9a-zA-Z]{6, 36}
```
for **Credentials::password**:
```
.{6, 36}
```

## Game connection

### Game
```c++
struct Game {
    string name;
    int maxNumPlayers;
    Mode mode;
    Map map;
}
```

### GameInfo
This type inherits [Game](#game).
```c++
struct GameInfo: GameInfo {
    int id;
    UserInfo owner;
    int curNumPlayers;
}
```
### LobbyInfo
This type inherits [GameInfo](#gameinfo) and [Data](#data).
```c++
struct GameInfo: GameInfo, Data {
    string[] players;
}
```

### Mode
Type, which describes the mode of the game. Enum. **(TBD)**

### Map
Type, which describes the map of the game. Enum. **(TBD)**
